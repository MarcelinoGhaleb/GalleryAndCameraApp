# Camera App

## Description
This is a simple React Native camera application that allows users to take photos, view them in a gallery, and see their current location on a map. It utilizes various React Native components, including Camera, FlatList, and MapView, along with third-party libraries such as react-native-vision-camera and react-native-maps.

## Features
- **Camera Screen**: Allows users to access their device's camera, switch between front and back cameras, take photos, and save them to the device's photo gallery.
- **Gallery Screen**: Displays the photos saved on the device, with the ability to load more photos as the user scrolls through the gallery. Users can also pull down to refresh the gallery.
- **API Screen**: Fetches data from a mock API endpoint and displays a list of characters with their names and images. Users can tap on a character to view additional information and long-press to delete a character.
- **Home Screen**: Provides a welcome message, a button to navigate to the Camera screen, displays the user's current location on a map, and shows the current latitude and longitude coordinates.
